User Management system using php, html, css
Developed a web project that has 3 layers: Database, Backend/API and FrontEnd. 
Frontend has two parts, one for Admin and one for External users. 
Admin Frontend should show a table of all external users and their info (this page should be authentication protected)
External users Frontend should provide a simple form for users to enter their personal info including First Name, Last Name, Telephone Number, Full Address, and SSN.

In the Backend, you should receive the user's info and do the following:
Encrypt SSN and store it in the DB
Store the rest of info as plain text in the DB

#### Download Project and...
1. Put it in htdocs.
2. Create two sql tables, one user with UserId, First Name, Last Name, Telephone Number, Full Address, and SSN all set to text.
3. Create a table admin with username = admin and password = admin.

#### Once everything is configured properly then run it.
1. Users can store their information in database and it shows that data is recorded.
2. Once admin is logged in their system then it is able to show tables on dashboard.

This is project is developed in Core PHP, HTML, CSS. It is my first attempt to learn PHP.
